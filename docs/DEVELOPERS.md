UE4SSLuaEventBridge exposes two API layers:

| Layer | Use it when | Ownership |
|---|---|---|
| Library primitives | The game or another mod already owns the Input Actions and mappings | The caller owns Unreal assets and mapping contexts |
| Input helpers | A mod wants to bind a physical key without shipping Input Action assets | The returned input scope owns transient actions, triggers, mappings, and native subscriptions |

Both layers are game-agnostic. The caller supplies exact live object paths; the
bridge does not discover a player controller, pawn, local player, input
component, or subsystem.

## Requirements and execution model

The current build targets:

- UE4SS 3.0.1 Beta #0 at commit `97b7e501`;
- Unreal Engine 5.5; and
- Windows x64.

Operations that resolve or mutate Unreal objects must run on the Unreal game
thread. Initialize and shut down inside `ExecuteInGameThread`:

```lua
ExecuteInGameThread(function()
    -- Open, bind, unbind, and close here.
end)
```

Every helper entry point checks the native UE4SS game-thread state before it
constructs, configures, registers, or removes an Unreal object. An off-thread
call returns an error without partially changing the input scope.

Native input execution never enters Lua. It copies event data into a queue,
and the bridge dispatches Lua callbacks later from its UE4SS update callback.
If a callback needs to change bindings, it must schedule that work with
`ExecuteInGameThread`.

The bridge installs no `ProcessEvent` hook. Helpers do invoke ordinary
reflected Enhanced Input functions through UE4SS to create and register their
private objects.

## Version and capabilities

```lua
local version = UE4SSLuaEventBridge.GetVersion()
local capabilities = UE4SSLuaEventBridge.GetCapabilities()
```

The current API reports:

```lua
{
    api = 5,
    enhanced_input = true,
    explicit_target = true,
    helpers = true,
    dynamic_input = true,
    trigger_tap = true,
    trigger_hold = true,
    detailed_errors = true,
    debug_tracing = true,
    binding_snapshot = true,
    target_delivery_faults = true,
    loop_start = true,
    object_lifetimes = true,
    target_ue4ss_commit = "97b7e501",
}
```

Gate optional features on `GetCapabilities()`. `GetVersion()` identifies the
product release; `API_VERSION` identifies the API contract. A version number
is useful metadata, but a poor crystal ball.

`object_lifetimes` is `true` only after a one-time runtime ABI probe validates
the configured UObject internal-index and object-item pointer/serial offsets
against multiple live `UClass` objects. A failed probe leaves the capability
false, skips listener registration, and makes every lifetime operation fail
closed for the process.

## Loop start and object lifetimes

`onLoopStart(callback)` registers a one-shot callback for the owning Lua
session. It runs from the first native `on_update` after that session starts,
before the Enhanced Input queue's rate check. It is intended for work that must
wait until the initial Lua-module loading batch has returned. The callback runs
on UE4SS's update thread; schedule Unreal object work with
`ExecuteInGameThread`. The returned function cancels a callback that has not yet
run and returns whether cancellation succeeded. Registering after delivery is
an error. Callback failures are logged and do not prevent other sessions or
callbacks from running.

```lua
local unsubscribe = UE4SSLuaEventBridge.onLoopStart(function()
    ExecuteInGameThread(function()
        -- Resolve initial live objects here.
    end)
end)
```

The lifetime API assigns a non-owning decimal-string token to a live UObject
address:

```lua
local token, err = UE4SSLuaEventBridge.lifetimes.captureObject(object)
local trustedToken, trustedError =
    UE4SSLuaEventBridge.lifetimes.captureAddress(address)
local stillLive = UE4SSLuaEventBridge.lifetimes.valid(address, token)
local lostToken, lossError = UE4SSLuaEventBridge.lifetimes.takeLost()
```

Use `captureObject` for ordinary UE4SS UObject wrappers. It checks `IsValid()`
and obtains `GetAddress()` synchronously before native identity validation. Use
`captureAddress` only for a trusted address obtained from a freshly resolved live
object; a retained numeric address cannot prove its own provenance. Call all
lifetime operations on the Unreal game thread. A token
does not root the object. Native object-array listeners invalidate observations
without entering Lua; `takeLost` drains one invalidated token at a time from the
calling session. Tokens and loss queues are isolated between Lua sessions and
are cleared when their session stops. Address or object-array index reuse gets a
new token because identity also includes the current object-item serial number.

Each session permits 4,096 live observations and 4,096 queued losses. Exceeding
the observation limit rejects a new capture. Loss-queue overflow faults the
session's lifetime service: all subsequent validations fail, capture is rejected,
and `takeLost` returns an error instructing the consumer to discard cached object
state and reload its Lua session. This fail-closed behavior avoids treating an
incomplete invalidation stream as trustworthy.

## Library primitives

Every Lua mod receives an isolated `UE4SSLuaEventBridge` table after its Lua state starts. Target and
subscription handles belong to the Lua session that created them.

### `OpenInputComponent(componentPath)`

```lua
local target, err = UE4SSLuaEventBridge.OpenInputComponent(componentPath)
```

`componentPath` is the exact live object path of a
`UEnhancedInputComponent`, not a class or content asset path. The component is
resolved only during this call and retained as a native weak reference.

Returns a numeric target handle, or `nil, errorMessage`.

### `BindAction(target, actionPath, eventName, callback)`

```lua
local handle, err = UE4SSLuaEventBridge.BindAction(
    target,
    "/Game/Input/IA_Example.IA_Example",
    "Triggered",
    function(event)
        print(event.action, event.phase)
    end)
```

This binds an existing `UInputAction`. It does not create an action, trigger,
key mapping, or mapping context.

Supported event names are `Started`, `Ongoing`, `Triggered`, `Canceled`, and
`Completed`. The callback receives:

```lua
{
    subscription = 1,
    source_type = "enhanced_input",
    action = "/Game/Input/IA_Example.IA_Example",
    phase = "Triggered",
    sequence = 27,
    elapsed_processed = 0.501,
    elapsed_triggered = 0.0,
    value = { x = 1.0, y = 0.0, z = 0.0, type = 0 },
}
```

`value.type` uses Unreal's Enhanced Input values: Boolean `0`, Axis1D `1`,
Axis2D `2`, and Axis3D `3`. Both elapsed fields come from Enhanced Input; the
bridge does not measure time itself.

### `Unbind(handle)`

```lua
local removed, err = UE4SSLuaEventBridge.Unbind(handle)
```

Deactivates the callback and removes its native action-event binding. It
returns `true` when the calling session owns the handle and removal completes.
On failure it returns `false, errorMessage`.

### `CloseInputComponent(target)`

```lua
local closed, err = UE4SSLuaEventBridge.CloseInputComponent(target)
```

Unbinds subscriptions attached through the target and releases the target
handle. It never destroys the Unreal component.
On failure it returns `false, errorMessage`.

### `UnbindAll()`

```lua
local count, completed, err = UE4SSLuaEventBridge.UnbindAll()
```

Attempts to close all helper scopes in the current Lua session, then removes
any remaining native subscriptions. It returns the number of native
subscriptions removed. `completed` is `true` only when helper and native
cleanup both complete. On failure the third result contains the combined
cleanup errors. Prefer each helper scope's `Close()` method when its lifetime
is known.

The compatibility aliases `SubscribeEnhancedInput`, `Unsubscribe`, and
`UnsubscribeAll` remain available.

## Opt-in target delivery faults

API 4 exposes `GetCapabilities().target_delivery_faults == true` when the
following additive methods are available. Older runtimes must be capability-gated.
Use a dedicated primitive target for inputs that must stop after delivery loss.

```lua
local target = assert(bridge.OpenInputComponent(componentPath))
local ok, err = bridge.SetTargetDeliveryFaultHandler(target, function(fault)
    -- Runs on the UE4SS update thread, not the native input producer.
    -- Clear consumer held/display state and invalidate its local lifecycle epoch.
    resetInputState(fault.reason)
    -- Schedule owned mapping/context cleanup on the game thread.
end)
assert(ok, err)
-- Bind all phases, then activate the caller-owned mapping context.
```

`SetTargetDeliveryFaultHandler(target, callback)` returns `true`, or `false,
errorMessage`. It requires the game thread and a target owned by the current
Lua session. Register once, before the target has ever successfully bound an
action. There is no handler replacement, opt-out or automatic rearm.

The first queue-capacity rejection, queue allocation/production exception, or
Lua action-callback error permanently invalidates the opted-in target. Reasons
are `queue_capacity_exceeded`, `queue_exception`, and `callback_error`.
All its subscriptions stop producing/delivering events, including older queued
`Started` events. Non-opted-in targets retain their previous behavior; unrelated
targets are not invalidated. The first reason is retained and notifications
coalesce to one attempt per target.

The handler receives `{target = targetHandle, reason = reason}` independently
of event/trace queue capacity. The bridge checks pending fault notifications
before ordinary dispatch, including when no new event arrives, and between
queued deliveries. Closing the target or stopping its session cancels pending
notification. A throwing handler is reported to the native debugger and is not
retried; the target stays invalid. Notification can be delayed by the normal
20 Hz dispatch schedule, host scheduling or an already-running Lua callback.
Callbacks already executing are not preempted.

`IsTargetDeliveryValid(target)` returns `true` for an opted-in target with no
known delivery fault. Otherwise it returns `false, reason`; unknown, closed,
stopped, cross-session and non-opted-in targets also return false. This query
is thread-safe and does not access Unreal objects. It checks delivery state,
not component validity, key actuation, application focus or mapping activation.
Call it on demand immediately before a scheduled side effect, alongside the
consumer's captured lifecycle epoch and gameplay gates:

```lua
local capturedTarget, capturedEpoch = target, inputEpoch
ExecuteInGameThread(function()
    if inputEpoch ~= capturedEpoch then return end
    if not bridge.IsTargetDeliveryValid(capturedTarget) then return end
    -- Perform an otherwise validated effect here. This is not a physical-key check.
end)
```

Target IDs are never reused within the bridge lifetime. For recovery, explicitly
close the old target, reset consumer state, create a new target, register its
handler and recreate subscriptions before activating input. The caller retains
ownership of its Input Actions and mapping contexts and must clean them up.
This policy does not resolve off-thread context cleanup, focus loss, missing
engine phase events, or simultaneous physical-release/side-effect ordering.
It adds no timer or consumer polling requirement. Healthy-path notification
checks use an atomic read; only fault processing scans target records.

## Input helpers

Helpers create private transient Enhanced Input objects so the mod can bind an
Unreal key name directly:

```lua
local Helpers = UE4SSLuaEventBridge.Helpers
local Trigger = Helpers.Trigger
```

The supported trigger constants, `Trigger.Tap` and `Trigger.Hold`, are opaque
and read-only. Unreal evaluates both triggers.

### `Helpers.OpenInput(options)`

```lua
local input, err = Helpers.OpenInput({
    component_path = COMPONENT_PATH,
    subsystem_path = ENHANCED_INPUT_SUBSYSTEM_PATH,
    mapping_priority = 0,
    debug = false,
    debug_label = "MyMod",
})
```

Required options:

- `component_path`: exact live path of the `UEnhancedInputComponent` that
  receives generated action bindings.
- `subsystem_path`: exact live path of the
  `UEnhancedInputLocalPlayerSubsystem` that receives private mapping contexts.

`mapping_priority` is an optional signed 32-bit context priority and defaults
to `0`. `debug` is an optional boolean and defaults to `false`.
`debug_label` is an optional 1..64 byte label and defaults to `"input"`.
`OpenInput` performs no discovery. It resolves both supplied objects and
returns an input scope, or `nil, errorMessage`. It does not install a mapping
until `Bind` succeeds.

### `input:Bind(key, trigger, callback [, options])`

```lua
local handle, err = input:Bind("F10", Trigger.Tap, function(event)
    print(event.key .. " tapped\n")
end, {
    threshold_seconds = 0.2,
})
```

Each successful call creates and owns one transient Input Mapping Context,
Boolean Input Action, Tap or Hold trigger, key mapping, and native `Triggered`
subscription. A private context per binding makes removal independent and
avoids mutating a context that is already active.

Generated actions default to `bConsumeInput = false`, so Tap and Hold actions
on the same key can both be evaluated and the helper does not intentionally
consume the game's mapping.

Common options:

| Option | Type | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `consume_input` | boolean | `false` | Sets the generated Input Action's consume-input flag |
| `trigger_when_paused` | boolean | Unreal default | Sets the generated Input Action's paused-trigger flag |

Tap options:

| Option | Type | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `threshold_seconds` | non-negative number | Unreal default | Sets `TapReleaseTimeThreshold` |

Hold options:

| Option | Type | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `threshold_seconds` | non-negative number | Unreal default | Sets `HoldTimeThreshold` |
| `one_shot` | boolean | Unreal default | Sets `bIsOneShot` |

```lua
local handle, err = input:Bind("F10", Trigger.Hold, function(event)
    print(string.format("held for %.0f ms\n", event.elapsed_processed * 1000))
end, {
    threshold_seconds = 0.5,
    one_shot = true,
})
```

With `one_shot = false`, Enhanced Input may emit `Triggered` repeatedly while
the key remains actuated. The helper does not suppress or synthesize events.

The helper callback contains the primitive event payload plus:

```lua
{
    key = "F10",
    trigger = Trigger.Hold,
    scope_id = 1,
    binding_id = 2,
}
```

The `action` field is the transient generated action path. It is an
implementation detail and is not stable across sessions; use `key` and
`trigger` instead.

### `input:Unbind(handle)`

```lua
local removed, err = input:Unbind(handle)
```

Removes the native subscription and its private mapping context, then releases
the action and trigger references. A handle from another scope is rejected.
Do not pass helper-owned handles to the primitive `Unbind`; doing so bypasses
the helper's mapping-context ownership.

### `input:Close()`

```lua
local closed, err = input:Close()
```

Closes all bindings owned by the scope, removes their private mapping
contexts, and closes the component target. `Close` is idempotent. If a cleanup
step fails, ownership is retained so a later game-thread call can retry it.
`Bind` after a successful close returns `nil, "input scope is closed"`.

Call `Close()` on the game thread before reload or shutdown. See
[session cleanup](#session-cleanup-and-rebinding) for automatic cleanup limits.

## Complete Tap/Hold example

The [sample entry point](../examples/EnhancedInputTapHold/Scripts/main.lua)
binds F10 to independent Tap and Hold actions, with failure rollback and explicit
shutdown. Copy the [sample directory](../examples/EnhancedInputTapHold) to
`Mods/EnhancedInputTapHold`, replace its two live object paths, and enable the
sample and bridge.

Set `DEBUG_BRIDGE = true` to trace action phases and delivery. Call
`EnhancedInputTapHold_Shutdown()` from your reload or shutdown path while the
Lua state is still alive.

## Ownership, errors, and lifecycle

Primitive return values are documented with each method. Helper option-contract
violations raise Lua errors; operational failures return `nil, errorMessage` or
`false, errorMessage`.

Helper creation and binding are transactional. A failure removes any newly
installed context. If removal fails, the scope retains a cleanup record for
`Close()` to retry; earlier successful bindings remain active. Generated objects
stay referenced while their contexts or bindings are owned by the scope.

`UnbindAll()` disables callback delivery before attempting game-thread cleanup.
If helper cleanup fails, native removal preserves targets for retry and clears
obsolete subscription handles when removal succeeds. Retry `Close()` or
`UnbindAll()` to finish cleanup. Failed attempts do not resume delivery.

Deactivation rejects queued callbacks but cannot preempt a callback already
executing. Consumers that schedule additional work must also check their own
lifecycle state before that work runs. See [target delivery faults](#opt-in-target-delivery-faults)
for optional native delivery-health checks.

### Session cleanup and rebinding

Close scopes explicitly on the game thread before stopping or reloading Lua.
A game-thread Lua stop also attempts helper cleanup. An off-thread stop disables
callbacks and defers native binding removal until the next game-thread bridge
operation, but cannot remove helper mapping contexts after the Lua state dies.
Cleanup is a lifecycle operation, not a farewell wish.

Callback closures live in Lua-owned tables and are released on bind failure,
unbind, target close, unbind-all, or callback failure. One dispatcher registry
reference remains until the Lua state closes. Session and child-state alias
lookup is synchronized; stopped session storage remains inert until bridge
destruction so in-flight references cannot outlive it.

If Unreal still owns a binding or clone when the bridge unloads, the DLL retains
a process-lifetime module reference to keep its vtable callable. Explicitly
removing owned bindings avoids this retention when no engine-owned clones remain.

When the game replaces an input component, close the old target, resolve the new
component path, and bind again. Discovery, gameplay gates, and rebinding remain
the consumer's responsibility.

## Inspection and debugging

### Optional debug tracing

Enable tracing on one helper scope when an Enhanced Input callback appears to
be missing:

```lua
local input, err = Helpers.OpenInput({
    component_path = COMPONENT_PATH,
    subsystem_path = ENHANCED_INPUT_SUBSYSTEM_PATH,
    mapping_priority = 10000,
    debug = true,
    debug_label = "MyMod",
})
```

Debug mode installs internal `Started`, `Completed`, and `Canceled` observers
in addition to the normal `Triggered` subscription. These observers only
report Enhanced Input phases; they never invoke the developer callback or
classify Tap versus Hold. `Ongoing` is intentionally omitted because it can
produce a trace line every input-processing frame.

Each trace is written through UE4SS's normal log output in this form:

```text
[UE4SSLuaEventBridge][trace] label="MyMod" stage="event_queued" scope=1 binding=2 key="F10" trigger="Hold" phase="Triggered" event_seq=17 thread_id=1248 game_thread=true reason="-"
```

Scope and binding IDs are monotonic and stable within one Lua session. Event
sequences are assigned atomically when a native delegate is entered. Lifecycle
records that do not belong to an input event use `event_seq=0`. Empty fields
are rendered as `"-"`.

| Stage | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `scope_opened` | `OpenInput` completed |
| `binding_created` | The primary native `Triggered` binding was attached |
| `enhanced_input_event` | Unreal emitted one of the observed action phases |
| `native_delegate_entered` | The bridge's native action delegate began |
| `event_queued` | A copied event was accepted for later Lua delivery |
| `event_rejected` | Delivery was refused; inspect `reason` |
| `event_dequeued` | The UE4SS update callback removed the event from the queue |
| `lua_callback_started` | The bridge began its protected Lua dispatcher call |
| `lua_callback_completed` | The Lua dispatcher returned successfully |
| `lua_callback_failed` | The Lua dispatcher raised an error |
| `callback_skipped` | A dequeued event no longer had an active binding or session |
| `binding_removed` | The primary native binding was detached |
| `scope_closed` | Helper mappings, subscriptions, and target were closed |

Possible reasons include `binding_inactive`, `dispatch_stopped`,
`queue_exception`, `lua_session_inactive`, and `unknown_lua_exception`.
Recognized Lua exceptions include their error text in `reason`. Every line also
records the current OS thread ID and whether UE4SS reports that thread as the
Unreal game thread.

Tracing begins at the generated Enhanced Input action. It does not detect or
report raw physical-key input, controller routing, gameplay state, or UI state.
Those belong to the consuming mod or a separate diagnostic layer.


## Binding snapshot API

Binding inspection is an additive API 4 capability, `binding_snapshot=true`.
Check `GetCapabilities()` before calling it. Compatibility is pinned to
UE4SS 97b7e501, Unreal 5.5 and Windows x64/MSVC; this API does not broaden it.

### Invocation

```lua
if UE4SSLuaEventBridge.GetCapabilities().binding_snapshot then
    ExecuteInGameThread(function()
        local text, err = input:InspectBindings()
        print(text or ("binding snapshot failed: " .. tostring(err)))
    end)
end
```

input is the caller's existing Helpers.OpenInput scope. Primitive equivalent: UE4SSLuaEventBridge.InspectInputComponent(targetHandle).
Both return one multiline string on successful inspection, or nil,error for invalid target/session, stopped backend/session, off-thread call, closed scope or failure to produce the snapshot. Invalid component/array/binding states are data in a successful snapshot. No debug=true requirement. No automatic logging, cleanup/reaping, object creation, discovery, polling, rebinding or callback execution.

### Schema 1

Header: target; game_thread=1; component_valid; component_index/serial; array_readable; array_invariants; array_size/capacity; entries_readable.
Per subscription: subscription; scope; binding (same IDs as debug traces); active; member; metadata_readable; expected_action_index/serial/valid; expected_trigger; expected_handle.
When metadata is readable: action_index/serial; action_valid; action_matches; trigger; trigger_matches; handle; handle_matches.
Footer: snapshot_end reported=N truncated=0/1. Numeric boolean fields are 0/1. action_valid is unknown on identity mismatch: an untrusted copied action index is never passed to object resolution.
Trigger enums: Triggered=1, Started=2, Ongoing=4, Canceled=8, Completed=16. No event_seq because this is not an input event.
Maximum 256 owned subscription rows (roughly <128 KiB text); original native array capacity must be below 65536, with valid size/capacity/pointer alignment before bounded copying. Readable=false means downstream conclusions are unavailable; member=0 with entries_readable=0 does not establish absence. Likewise metadata fields are omitted if not readable. Row order is unspecified.

### Safety and limits

Uses the pinned object-array resolver for bridge-recorded weak references. Copies object-item fields, native array and metadata with ReadProcessMemory, validating full read length. Never dereferences array entries; only reads metadata at addresses recorded during original attachment after pointer membership is established. Does not invoke virtual methods on diagnostic binding pointers. Expected action identity and native handle are captured at original attachment.
The component class/layout was verified at OpenInput/bind; diagnostic reads only the existing ABI-pinned array offset after resolving the recorded weak reference. This is not a compatibility detector for other engine versions.
Original pointer membership and matching metadata do not prove engine input-stack participation, action evaluation, or delegate invocation. Engine-created clones are not individually tracked by this diagnostic. Arbitrary native memory corruption and allocator address reuse cannot be comprehensively certified by a snapshot. Snapshot observes stored subscriptions with original live-binding records; it does not enumerate foreign bindings.

### Interpreting a snapshot

Capture on demand in the game thread and retain the complete header, rows and
footer together. Check component weak identity and array readability before
interpreting membership or action/trigger/handle matches. A truncated snapshot
does not describe all subscriptions. Debug observers can add subscriptions beyond
the bindings a caller explicitly requested.

An intact snapshot establishes stored binding state only. Investigating missing
input also requires independent evidence of action evaluation and input routing;
absence of a bridge callback alone does not identify where an event was lost.
The native fixture tests cover bounds, identity and read gates, and Lua fixtures
cover API forwarding and failure handling. They do not certify a live Unreal
object layout or replace integration testing for the target build.

## Dispatch limits and tuning

Configure these process environment variables before starting the game. Values
are read once at bridge construction; changes require a restart. Invalid or
out-of-range values use the defaults.

| Variable | Default | Accepted integers | Zero means |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `UE4SSLEB_QUEUE_CHECKS_PER_SECOND` | 20 | 1–1,000 | Invalid; uses default |
| `UE4SSLEB_MAX_EVENTS_PER_PASS` | 256 | 0–1,000,000 | No callback-count limit |
| `UE4SSLEB_MAX_DISPATCH_US` | 2,000 | 0–1,000,000 | No time limit |
| `UE4SSLEB_MAX_QUEUED_EVENTS` | 65,536 | 0–1,000,000 | Unbounded producer queue |

For a PowerShell launcher:

```powershell
$env:UE4SSLEB_QUEUE_CHECKS_PER_SECOND = '40'
# Start the game from this process so it inherits the variable.
```

An already-running Steam process may not inherit a newly set launcher variable.

UE4SS still invokes on_update at its own cadence. Each invocation reads a monotonic
clock and returns before touching either queue when the next pass is not due.
The bridge creates no timer thread, sleeps, or catch-up bursts.

Each eligible pass continues the oldest batch in order, subject to existing
inactive-session/subscription and callback-error handling. The default allowance
is 256 live callback attempts or 2,000 microseconds per pass. Canceled bindings
and stopped sessions consume time but do not consume the callback-count allowance.
A failed callback attempt still counts. The first-progress allowance applies to
one examined entry, so an all-canceled batch cannot bypass the time limit. Remaining events stay in the batch
for the next eligible pass; new batches never overtake them. There is no sleep
between events. The time allowance starts before batch acquisition and buffer
recycling. Dequeue tracing is performed only for each admitted event, inside the
same budget; acquiring a batch does not format traces for the entire batch.
The allowance is non-preemptive: preparation, lock waits, or one slow Lua callback
can exceed it. At least one event is processed per nonempty pass to avoid starvation.

Disabling both per-pass limits drains the available batch without a dispatch
budget. A full producer queue rejects newest events, preserves accepted-event
order, and logs the overflow even with tracing disabled. Treat rejection as an
input-delivery failure. A larger queue stores more backlog; it does not make a
slow callback faster.

`UE4SSLuaEventBridge.GetDispatchStats()` returns process-wide `queued` (producer
queue plus the retained consumer batch, excluding the event currently being
processed), `queue_high_water` (producer queue only), `rejected_events` and
`rejected_traces` counters. Canceled entries remain queued until discarded.
The producer limit and high-water mark still describe producer capacity; total
`queued` can exceed both while a previous batch is retained.
Counters last for the bridge lifetime. Read them on demand; no diagnostic polling
is added by the bridge. A rejection must be treated as an input delivery failure.

Trace buffering is capped at 1,024 lines. Each pass separately allows 32 lines or
250 microseconds of Lua logging work, while preserving buffered line order.
Excess diagnostics increment `rejected_traces`. Native debugger tracing remains
synchronous when enabled; keep debug tracing off for gameplay measurements.

The 50 ms interval is between pass starts, not a sleep after completion. Actual
delivery can take longer because of UE4SS scheduling and slow callbacks. A slow
pass does not trigger repeated catch-up passes. Sustained overload can still
increase event latency or cause explicit rejections. Fewer checks do not by themselves prove lower frame times. Test the new limits under the intended workload before deployment.

See the [maintainer guide](BUILD.md#testing-and-validation-limits) for validation boundaries.

For inputs that must stop after delivery loss, use
[target delivery faults](#opt-in-target-delivery-faults). Those notifications
are independent of the bounded event and trace queues.
